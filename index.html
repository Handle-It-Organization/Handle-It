<p>This Android Application was created by Scott Lowry. It came about because I felt there was too much information spread all over the internet. Handle It is designed to put that information you are looking for in one place. If you have a leak in you roof or a broken dishwasher and don't know what to do, just Handle It and members of the Handle It community will be able to help by offering advice based off of their similar experiences. This is still in the very early stages and only allow users to post photos. My future goal is to have the users be able to post text, photos, and videos if they like.    </p>
